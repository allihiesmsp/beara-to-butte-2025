        <h1>Beara to Butte 2025</h1>
        <h2>Shared Heritage Coffee Table</h2>
<p>This Table has been gifted to the people of Butte, Montana, as a memento of the visit of the largest group of Beara People to ever visit Butte as cultural tourists. </p>
<p>The table is hand crafted and styled as an interpretive art piece, with three main symbolic components: the Beara Leg, the Butte Leg & the Table Top. </p>
<p><strong>The Beara Leg</strong> is inspired by the North Engine House of the Mountain Mine in Allihies, Beara, Co Cork, Republic of Ireland. A distinctive skyline structure, it stands as a daily reminder of Beara's copper mining past. This table leg is made from Irish white oak grown in Co Cork, and also incorporates some quartz copper ore from the Mountain Mine. </p>
<p><strong>The Butte Leg</strong> is inspired by the Original Mine headframe of Butte, Montana USA. This again is a distinctive skyline structure in Butte. The Butte Leg is made from reclaimed American Pitch Pine (Pinus Rigida) wood. </p>
<p>This wood has a fascinating story. It was shipped to the Allihies Copper Mines in the mid-1800s, in kit form, to create miners’ huts. By the early 20th century, the wood had been repurposed as a family home at Skibbereen, West Cork. In the late 1940s, this home was purchased by the Roycroft family of Grain Millers and Merchants. Thankfully, the Roycroft family had the foresight to preserve its precious history, and gifted some of the wood back to the people of Allihies and Butte. </p>
<p>So this wood has come from North America to the Allihies Copper mines, to a Skibbereen family home, back to Allihies and now back to North America. A real full circle story!</p>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>Table Top</strong> represents the “bridge” between the communities of Beara and Butte. It is made from ash, a hardwood with distinctive grain patterns that thrives in both North America and Ireland. </p>
